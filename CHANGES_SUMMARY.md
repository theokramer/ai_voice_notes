## 🔐 Security Status

### Current Setup (Good for MVP/Launch)
✅ API keys in .env file  
✅ Keys not committed to git  
✅ Documentation of risks  
⚠️ Keys bundled with app (extractable)

### Recommended for Scale (Post-Launch)
- Backend proxy for API calls
- Server-side key management
- Rate limiting per user
- See `SECURITY.md` for implementation guide

**For initial launch**: Current setup is acceptable with monitoring

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Read**: `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` for detailed checklist
2. **Review**: `SECURITY.md` for security considerations
3. **Complete**: Pre-launch checklist items
4. **Build**: `flutter build ios --release`
5. **Test**: On physical device
6. **Submit**: Through Xcode → App Store Connect

**Estimated Time to App Store Submission**: 1-2 weeks  
(Assuming you create assets and legal docs)
