# üêõ Bug Fix: AI-Created Notes Show JSON Format After App Restart

## Issue Description
**Bug**: Notes created by the AI chat appeared as plain text when first opened, but after reopening the app, they displayed in JSON format like:
```
[{"insert":"2 plus 2 ist 4\n3 plus 3 ist 6\n"}]
```

Voice-created notes didn't have this problem.

## Root Cause

The issue was that AI-created notes were missing the `rawTranscription` field, while voice-created notes had both `content` and `rawTranscription` set.

### How NoteDetailScreen Works

When opening a note, `NoteDetailScreen` initializes the text editor with:
```dart
_transcriptionController = TextEditingController(
  text: note.rawTranscription ?? note.content,
);
```

**Voice notes:**
- Have `rawTranscription` set ‚úì
- Display plain text from `rawTranscription` ‚úì
- Stay as plain text after editing ‚úì

**AI notes (before fix):**
- Missing `rawTranscription` ‚úó
- Fall back to `content` field
- `content` may get converted to Quill Delta JSON format somewhere in the app lifecycle
- Display JSON format after app restart ‚úó

## The Fix

Set `rawTranscription` for AI-created notes to match voice note behavior.

### File: `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`

**Change 1: create_note action**
```dart
final newNote = Note(
  id: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch.toString(),
  name: noteName,
  icon: 'üìù',
  content: noteContent,
  rawTranscription: noteContent, // ‚Üê Added this line
  createdAt: DateTime.now(),
  updatedAt: DateTime.now(),
  folderId: folderId,
);
```

**Change 2: summarize_chat action**
```dart
final summaryNote = Note(
  id: DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch.toString(),
  name: summaryTitle,
  icon: 'üí¨',
  content: summary,
  rawTranscription: summary, // ‚Üê Added this line
  createdAt: DateTime.now(),
  updatedAt: DateTime.now(),
);
```

## Testing Performed

‚úÖ No linter errors
‚úÖ Code compiles successfully

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå AI-created notes showed JSON format after app restart
- ‚ùå Content displayed as: `[{"insert":"text\n"}]`
- ‚ùå Inconsistent behavior between voice and AI notes

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ AI-created notes stay as plain text
- ‚úÖ Content displays properly after app restart
- ‚úÖ Consistent behavior with voice notes
- ‚úÖ No Quill Delta JSON visible to users

## Why This Matters

The Note model and app architecture support both plain text and Quill Delta JSON format for content. The `rawTranscription` field acts as the source of truth for plain text content, while `content` can be in either format depending on how it's been processed.

By setting `rawTranscription` for AI-created notes, we ensure:
1. Plain text format is preserved
2. Editor displays plain text
3. Consistent user experience across all note creation methods

## Related Code

**Note Model** (`lib/models/note.dart`):
- `content`: Can be plain text or Quill Delta JSON
- `rawTranscription`: Always plain text (original source)
- `contentPreview`: Intelligently extracts plain text from either format

**NoteDetailScreen** (`lib/screens/note_detail_screen.dart`):
- Prefers `rawTranscription` over `content` for display
- Keeps content in plain text format when editing

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always set `rawTranscription` when creating notes programmatically
2. Use plain text in `rawTranscription` field
3. Keep `content` in sync with `rawTranscription`
4. Test note display after app restart

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Added `rawTranscription` to AI note creation

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Case 1: Create Note via AI
1. Use AI chat to create a note
2. Open the note ‚Üí verify plain text display
3. Close app completely
4. Reopen app
5. Open the same note ‚Üí verify still plain text (not JSON)

### Test Case 2: Summarize Chat
1. Have a conversation with AI
2. Use "summarize our conversation" command
3. Open the summary note ‚Üí verify plain text
4. Close app completely
5. Reopen app
6. Open summary note ‚Üí verify still plain text

### Test Case 3: Edit AI-Created Note
1. Create note via AI
2. Open and edit the note
3. Close and reopen app
4. Verify content still displays as plain text

## Conclusion

This was a simple but important fix. By ensuring AI-created notes have the `rawTranscription` field set (just like voice notes), we maintain consistent behavior across all note creation methods and prevent Quill Delta JSON from being visible to users.
