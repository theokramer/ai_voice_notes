# Superwall Paywall Integration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a two-stage hard paywall system using Superwall SDK for Flutter. The implementation follows the exact flow specified:

1. User completes onboarding screens
2. First paywall appears (`onboarding_hard_paywall` - dismissible)
3. If dismissed → Second paywall appears (`app_launch_paywall` - non-dismissible)
4. User must subscribe to access the app
5. On purchase → User continues to main app

## Files Created

### 1. `/lib/services/subscription_service.dart`
- Singleton service that tracks subscription status
- Listens to Superwall's `subscriptionStatus` stream
- Persists subscription state to SharedPreferences
- Methods:
  - `initialize()` - Load cached status and start listening
  - `markPaywallFlowComplete()` - Mark when user subscribes
  - `checkSubscriptionStatus()` - Verify current status
  - `resetPaywallFlowStatus()` - For testing
  - `clearData()` - Clear all data

### 2. `/lib/services/paywall_flow_controller.dart`
- Manages the sequential paywall presentation flow
- Uses `PaywallPresentationHandler` with callbacks:
  - `onPresentHandler` - When paywall is shown
  - `onDismissHandler` - When paywall is dismissed (checks purchase status)
  - `onErrorHandler` - When paywall fails to load
  - `onSkipHandler` - When user is already subscribed
- Implements non-dismissible behavior by re-showing second paywall
- Shows retry dialog on errors
- Navigates to HomeScreen only after successful purchase

## Files Modified

### 1. `/pubspec.yaml`
- Added: `superwallkit_flutter: ^2.0.0`

### 2. `/lib/main.dart`
- Imported Superwall SDK
- Configured Superwall with API key from `.env` file
- Added before `runApp()`

### 3. `/lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`
- Modified `_completeOnboarding()` method
- Removed direct navigation to HomeScreen
- Now calls `PaywallFlowController().showOnboardingPaywallFlow(context)`
- Preserves all onboarding data saving logic

### 4. `/lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
- Added `SubscriptionService` initialization
- Updated navigation logic:
  - Not completed onboarding → `OnboardingScreen`
  - Completed onboarding + subscribed → `HomeScreen`
  - Completed onboarding + not subscribed → `_PaywallFlowScreen` (shows paywalls)
- Added `_PaywallFlowScreen` widget for paywall loading state

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```
SUPERWALL_API_KEY=your_superwall_api_key_here
```

### Superwall Dashboard Setup
You mentioned these placements are already created:
1. **`onboarding_hard_paywall`** - First paywall (dismissible)
2. **`app_launch_paywall`** - Second paywall (hard paywall)

Ensure in your dashboard:
- Both placements are active
- Products are configured
- Paywalls are published
- Test mode enabled for development

## How It Works

### First Launch Flow
1. App starts → `SplashScreen`
2. Checks onboarding status
3. Not completed → Goes to `OnboardingScreen`
4. User completes onboarding
5. `PaywallFlowController.showOnboardingPaywallFlow()` called
6. First paywall (`onboarding_hard_paywall`) shown
7. If dismissed → Second paywall (`app_launch_paywall`) shown
8. Second paywall keeps re-showing until purchase
9. On purchase → Navigate to `HomeScreen`
10. Subscription status saved to SharedPreferences

### Subsequent Launches
1. App starts → `SplashScreen`
2. `SubscriptionService` checks subscription status
3. If subscribed → Direct to `HomeScreen`
4. If not subscribed → Shows paywall flow again

### Non-Dismissible Behavior
The second paywall implements hard paywall behavior:
```dart
if (result is PurchasedPaywallResult || result is RestoredPaywallResult) {
  // User purchased - navigate to home
  await _onPurchaseComplete(context);
} else {
  // User dismissed without purchase - show paywall again
  await _showSecondPaywall(context);
}
```

### Error Handling
- Network errors show custom retry dialog
- Dialog matches app's glassmorphic theme
- Options: "Retry" or "Exit App"
- Blocks access until paywall loads (as specified)

## Testing Instructions

### Development Testing

1. **Fresh Install Test**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
   - Complete onboarding
   - Verify first paywall appears
   - Dismiss first paywall
   - Verify second paywall appears
   - Try to dismiss second paywall
   - Verify it re-appears (non-dismissible)

2. **Purchase Flow Test**
   - Complete purchase in test environment
   - Verify navigation to HomeScreen
   - Close and restart app
   - Verify direct navigation to HomeScreen (no paywalls)

3. **Restore Purchase Test**
   - Tap "Restore Purchases" on paywall
   - Verify navigation to HomeScreen if subscription exists

4. **Error Handling Test**
   - Turn off network
   - Complete onboarding
   - Verify error dialog appears
   - Turn on network
   - Tap "Retry"
   - Verify paywall loads

### Reset Testing State
To test the flow again after purchase:
```dart
// Add this temporarily in your code (e.g., settings screen)
await SubscriptionService().resetPaywallFlowStatus();
await SubscriptionService().clearData();
final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
await prefs.setBool('has_completed_onboarding', false);
// Then restart app
```

## API Reference

### SubscriptionService
```dart
final subscriptionService = SubscriptionService();
await subscriptionService.initialize();

// Check if user is subscribed
bool isSubscribed = subscriptionService.isSubscribed;

// Check if user completed paywall flow
bool completed = subscriptionService.hasCompletedPaywallFlow;
```

### PaywallFlowController
```dart
final controller = PaywallFlowController();
await controller.showOnboardingPaywallFlow(context);
```

## Superwall API Used

### Configuration
```dart
await Superwall.configure(apiKey);
```

### Register Placement with Handler
```dart
final handler = PaywallPresentationHandler();
handler.onPresentHandler = (info) { /* ... */ };
handler.onDismissHandler = (info, result) { /* ... */ };
handler.onErrorHandler = (error) { /* ... */ };
handler.onSkipHandler = (reason) { /* ... */ };

await Superwall.shared.registerPlacement(placementName, handler: handler);
```

### Subscription Status Stream
```dart
Superwall.shared.subscriptionStatus.listen((status) {
  if (status is SubscriptionStatusActive) {
    // User is subscribed
  }
});
```

## Design Consistency

All paywall UI elements match your app's design system:
- **Colors**: Uses `SettingsProvider.currentThemeConfig`
- **Glassmorphism**: Error dialogs use `AppTheme.glassStrongSurface`
- **Animations**: Uses `flutter_animate` for smooth transitions
- **Haptics**: Calls `HapticService` for feedback
- **Fonts**: Inherits from `AppTheme` (Google Fonts Inter)

## Troubleshooting

### Paywall Not Showing
1. Check console for: `Superwall configured successfully`
2. Verify API key in `.env` file
3. Check dashboard - ensure placements are published
4. Check logs for placement name typos

### Paywall Shows But Can't Purchase
1. Ensure products are configured in Superwall dashboard
2. Check App Store Connect product setup (iOS)
3. Verify bundle ID matches
4. Check console for purchase errors

### App Stuck in Paywall Loop
1. Check subscription status in dashboard
2. Try restore purchases
3. Check console for subscription status logs
4. Clear app data and test fresh install

## Next Steps

1. **Test in Production**
   - Create production API key
   - Update `.env` for production builds
   - Test with real purchases

2. **Analytics**
   - Superwall automatically tracks paywall views
   - Track conversion rates in dashboard
   - Set up A/B tests for paywall variations

3. **Monitoring**
   - Watch for paywall load errors
   - Monitor subscription status changes
   - Track user flow through paywalls
