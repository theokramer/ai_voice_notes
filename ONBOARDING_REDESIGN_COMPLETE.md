## What You Need to Provide: App Mockups

For the **Feature Explanation Pages** to be even more compelling, you should create or capture these mockup images showing your app in action:

### Required Mockups (375x667px - iPhone dimensions):

1. **Recording Interface**
   - Show the microphone button being pressed
   - Display audio waveform animation
   - Capture the recording state UI

2. **AI Organization View**
   - Show a note with AI-generated headlines
   - Display organized text entries under headlines
   - Demonstrate the automatic organization

3. **Search/Find Feature**
   - Show the search interface
   - Display instant search results
   - Highlight the speed of finding notes

4. **Note Detail View**
   - Show a beautifully formatted note
   - Display all the features (headlines, entries, timestamps)
   - Demonstrate the clean reading experience

### How to Use Mockups:
Once you have these images, you can:
1. Place them in `assets/onboarding/mockups/` folder
2. Update the explanation pages to show real screenshots instead of placeholder icons
3. This will help users understand the app's features visually
