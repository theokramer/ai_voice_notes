# Export Fix & Single Note Share Feature

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Export Failed Error - iPad Share Sheet Position ‚úÖ

**Problem:**
The error message showed:
```
PlatformException(error, sharePositionOrigin: argument must be set, 
{{0, 0}, {0, 0}} must be non-zero and within coordinate space of 
source view: {{0, 0}, {420, 912}}, null, null)
```

This is a known iOS/iPadOS requirement: the share sheet needs a proper origin position on iPad to display as a popover.

**Solution:**
- Added `sharePositionOrigin` parameter to `ExportService.shareExport()`
- Calculate the position of the export dialog using `RenderBox`
- Pass this position to the share sheet
- Works on both iPhone (ignored) and iPad (required for popover)

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/export_service.dart` - Added `sharePositionOrigin` parameter
- `lib/widgets/export_dialog.dart` - Calculate and pass position

### 2. Single Note Export Feature ‚úÖ

Users can now export/share individual notes in a **human-readable Markdown format**.

## Technical Details

### Share Position Calculation

For iPad compatibility, we calculate the share origin position:

```dart
final box = context.findRenderObject() as RenderBox?;
final sharePositionOrigin = box != null
    ? box.localToGlobal(Offset.zero) & box.size
    : null;
```

This ensures:
- iPhone: Parameter is ignored, works as normal
- iPad: Popover appears at correct position
- No crashes on either platform

### Filename Sanitization

Note names are sanitized for filesystem compatibility:
```dart
note.name.replaceAll(RegExp(r'[^\w\s-]'), '')
```

Removes special characters that could cause filesystem issues.
