# Home Screen Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully redesigned the home screen with a clean, professional aesthetic focused on user experience optimization.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Simplified Header
**Before:**
- Cluttered with multiple buttons (search, settings)

- Reduced padding for better space utilization

### 2. ✅ Pull-to-Search Gesture
**Implementation:**
- Added `ScrollController` to detect overscroll at top of list
- Trigger threshold: -50px overscroll
- Smooth animated overlay with backdrop blur (sigmaX: 15, sigmaY: 15)
- Auto-focus on text field when revealed
- Tap outside or close button to dismiss
- Integrated with AI search functionality

**User Experience:**
- Modern, gesture-based interaction
- No permanent UI clutter
- Intuitive pull-down action
- Haptic feedback on reveal/hide

### 3. ✅ Consolidated Sort Options
**Before:**
- 4 horizontal scrolling chips
- Took up significant vertical space

- Label displays "Recent" or "A-Z" with direction arrow
- Opens clean bottom sheet with 2 main sort options:
  - Recently Updated (default: descending)
  - Alphabetical (default: ascending)
- Tapping selected option toggles direction
- Reduced to most commonly used options

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Visual Hierarchy
**Changes:**

- Search across note names, headlines, entries, and tags
- Results displayed as interactive cards
- Click any result to navigate to that note
- Progressive message display with animations
- Empty state with helpful examples

**Search Algorithm:**
- Keyword extraction (words > 2 chars)
