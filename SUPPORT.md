## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is Notie AI free?**  
A: Notie AI offers both free and premium versions. The free version includes basic voice recording and transcription. Premium unlocks unlimited recordings, advanced AI features, and priority support.

**Q: What languages does Notie AI support?**  
A: Notie AI supports 50+ languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic, and many more. The app automatically detects your language.

**Q: Do I need an internet connection?**  
A: Yes, you need an internet connection for:
- Voice transcription
- AI features (summaries, organization, chat)
- Syncing premium subscription status

Your notes are stored locally, so you can view them offline.

**Q: Where are my notes stored?**  
A: All your notes are stored **locally on your device**. We do not store your notes on our servers. This means your notes are private and secure, but you should export them regularly as a backup.

**Q: Can I use Notie AI on multiple devices?**  
A: Currently, Notie AI stores notes locally on each device. We're working on cloud sync for future updates. For now, use the export feature to transfer notes between devices.

### Recording & Transcription

**Q: How do I record a note?**  
A: Tap and **hold** the microphone button, speak your note, then release. Do not just tap—you must hold the button while speaking.

**Q: Why isn't my voice being recorded?**  
A: Check these:
1. Microphone permission is enabled (Settings > Notie AI > Microphone)
2. You're holding the button (not just tapping)
3. Your microphone isn't blocked or covered
4. Try restarting the app

**Q: Why is the transcription inaccurate?**  
A: To improve transcription accuracy:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Minimize background noise
- Hold the phone closer to your mouth
- Check your internet connection
- Try recording in shorter segments

**Q: Can I edit transcriptions?**  
A: Yes! Tap any note to open it, then tap the edit button to modify the transcribed text.

**Q: What happens to my audio recordings?**  
A: Audio files are temporarily stored on your device during transcription, then automatically deleted. We do not keep copies of your audio.

### Organization & Folders

**Q: How does auto-organization work?**  
A: Our AI analyzes your note content and automatically places it in the most relevant folder. If no good match exists, it may create a new folder or leave it in "Unorganized."

**Q: Can I move notes between folders?**  
A: Yes! Long-press on any note and select "Move to Folder" or use the organization screen.

**Q: How do I create a folder?**  
A: Tap the folder icon, then tap the "+" button to create a new folder. Choose a name and icon.

**Q: Can I delete folders?**  
A: Yes, but notes inside won't be deleted—they'll move to "Unorganized." System folders like "All Notes" cannot be deleted.

### AI Features

A: Notie AI offers:

- **Title Generation**: Automatic note titles

- "What did I note about the meeting?"
- "Create a shopping list note"
- "Summarize my notes from this week"

**Q: Are AI features available offline?**  
A: No, AI features require an internet connection as they use OpenAI's services.

**Q: Is my data used to train AI models?**  
A: No. According to OpenAI's policy, data sent through their API is not used to train models. Your data is retained for 30 days for abuse monitoring, then deleted.

### Export & Backup

**Q: How do I export my notes?**  
A: 
1. Go to Settings > Export Notes
2. Choose your preferred format (Text, Markdown, or JSON)
3. Select export method (Share or Save to Files)

**Q: What export formats are available?**  
A: 
- **Text (.txt)**: Simple text format
- **Markdown (.md)**: Formatted text with structure
- **JSON (.json)**: Complete data including metadata

**Q: How often should I backup my notes?**  
A: We recommend exporting your notes weekly or after creating important content. Since notes are stored locally, they'll be lost if you delete the app or reset your device.

**Q: Can I import notes from other apps?**  
A: Currently, Notie AI doesn't support importing. This feature is planned for future updates.
